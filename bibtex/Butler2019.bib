	abstract     = {Providing people who are blind or have low vision with accessible versions of artworks is important not just for equity, but also for inclusion, greater engagement with the community at large, and raising awareness about these issues. In 2018, a value-sensitive design methodology was used with the Bendigo Art Gallery and key stakeholders to develop a model that provides three different ways of accessing the gallery, depending upon visual acuity and mobility: virtual tours, self-guided tours and guided tours. As a pilot implementation of the model, we developed different tactile representations of key artworks using tactile graphics, laser-cut layered graphics, 3D printed models, soundscapes, role plays, and a website featuring information and representations requested by workshop participants. To highlight the work, this paper will present two of the key works in more detail to highlight different representations that should be considered when presenting accessible artworks.},
