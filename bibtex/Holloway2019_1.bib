	abstract     = {The difficulty and consequent fear of travel is one of the most disabling consequences of blindness and severe vision impairment, affecting confidence and quality of life. Traditional tactile graphics are vital in the Orientation and Mobility training process, however 3D printing may have the capacity to enable production of more meaningful and inclusive maps. This study explored the use of 3D printed maps on site at a public event to examine their suitability and to identify guidelines for the design of future 3D maps. An iterative design process was used in the production of the 3D maps, with feedback from visitors who are blind or have low vision informing the recommendations for their design and use. For example, it was found that many representational 3D icons could be recognised by touch without the need for a key and that such a map helped form mental models of the event space. Complex maps, however, require time to explore and should be made available before an event or at the entrance in a comfortable position. The maps were found to support the orientation and mobility process, and importantly to also promote a positive message about inclusion and accessibility.},
